The following issues have been fixed:

Level 009 "Recury", edge case incompletion due to redesign of
how disks are shifted, one orange disk was incorrectly placed.
This is fixed. (spotter: Grom PE)

Level 039 "Part Maker", a yellow disk was missing in the lower
right corner of the sokoban section, causing the fuse to be
incompletable. A seventh yellow disk was added and thus the
level is now solvable. (spotter: Grom PE)
