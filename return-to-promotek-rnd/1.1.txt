The following issues have been fixed:

Level 009 "Recury", edge case incompletion due to redesign of
how disks are shifted, one orange disk was incorrectly placed.
This is fixed. (spotter: Grom PE)

Level 026 "Code Black", there is no exit. This was rectified.
(spotter: Grom PE)

Level 039 "Part Maker", a yellow disk was missing in the lower
right corner of the sokoban section, causing the fuse to be
incompletable. A seventh yellow disk was added and thus the
level is now solvable. (spotter: Grom PE)

Level 062 "Left with this mess?", a problem in the shuffle
created an instance which left 3 infotrons unobtainable, thus
preventing the level to be solved. The problematic chips which
caused this issue were removed. (spotter: Grom PE)

Level 071 "Grid Work" had a typo in the infotron requirements.
It now correctly has a requirement of 41 infotrons.

Level 074 "Backdoor Access" had an incorrectly-adjusted pipe
preventing access to the exit. It is fixed. (spotter: Grom PE)
