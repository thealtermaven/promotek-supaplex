# Supaplex Levelset 10

This is the 2.0 version which has picked up after the 1.0 release at the Supaplex Homepage hosted by Maarten Egmond / Elmer Productions.
Included in this levelset is 72 extra levels, notably levels 70-111, rendering a complete levelset file. However, to do so I had to
remove the old level 70 "Through The Pipes" which was authored by Jussi Sipola. You can find this level as a standalone as "pipes.sp".

To install if you have the old 1.0 Levelset 10, simply overwrite LEVEL.L10 and LEVELS.D10 with this version.
* If you use vanilla DOSBox Supaplex, copy the old LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT and rename the two above files to LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT,
respectively.
* If you use DOSBox Speedfix or OpenSupaplex, use the Levelset swap function to navigate to Levelset 10.
* If you use Megaplex, use the levelset dropdown and select "LEVELS.D10" or use the File > Open command and navigate to the directory
containing LEVELS.D10.
* If you're using a commercial sourceport, you're SOL and you've been scammed. I cannot offer support. Please install either the DOSBox Speedfix or OpenSupaplex.

This levelset is dubbed "The Supaplex Incident" in 2019.
