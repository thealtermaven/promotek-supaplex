# promotek-supaplex
"The Promotek Incident", a Supaplex levelset.

This repo is created with the intent to help document versioning of edits for the levelset, including adding credits of individuals whom assisted in the edits of the levelset for the purpose of fixing outstanding bugs.

To grab this levelset:
* Navigate to the desired version folder.
* "Clone or Download" in that section to create a zip.
* Follow instructions in the provided !README.txt

This levelset requires Supaplex. You can get it for free. I prefer you to use the DOSBox SpeedFix version, Megaplex or OpenSupaplex to play this levelset. I do not support commercial or "freemium" ports. Don't ask how to include. Discussion of inclusion will be erased. Those ports are scams to me. They serve no beneficial advantages compared to the above free options. None. Nada.

Happy solving!
