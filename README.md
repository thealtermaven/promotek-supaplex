# Preface
This repo has archival versions of "The Supaplex Incident", a.k.a. Levelset 10 2.0; as well as "The Promotek Incident" 1.0 released in 16 June 2020 and other related levelsets.

# supaplex-incident
This is a levelset completed in 2003. The version in the repo is the 2005 third-party edit to make two levels solveable. This release is in the repo for archival purposes and it is more challenging than the Promotek Incident as well as other releases.

# promotek-incident
"The Promotek Incident", a Supaplex levelset, released 16 June 2020. 111 levels, 1 author. First release under the "Alchemystics Design" umbrella.

# return-to-promotek (NEW)
The Promotek Aftermath, or officially known as "Return to Promotek", is a Supaplex levelset, released 10 September 2020. 111 levels, 1 author. Second release under the "Alchemystics Design" umbrella, it is a more challenging "sequel" to "The Promotek Incident".

# To obtain this repo:
* Select "Code", then "Clone/Download" and elect to save as zip. Both standard and R'n'D versions will be bundled in the ZIP. R'n'D versions have "rnd" suffixed.

# To install:
If you are using Rocks'n'Diamonds, extract all "rnd" folders into your Documents folder:
* Linux - *~rocksndiamonds/levels*
* Mac - *Rocks’n’Diamonds/levels* in Documents
* Win - *Rocks’n’Diamonds/levels* in Documents
* Android - *Android/data/org.artsoft.rocksndiamonds/files/levels* in Device storage

Otherwise, peruse these instructions:
* *A copy of DOSBox Supaplex/Speedfix, OpenSupaplex or Megaplex is required. These are free.*
* Extract contents in an empty folder.
* Navigate to the desired version (newer versions have edits/fixes).
* Open !README.TXT and follow install instructions.
* * This usually involves backing up the original LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT if you are using vanilla DOSBox Supaplex.
* * You can also opt to change LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT to LEVEL.L?? and LEVELS.D?? where ?? is a number from 00-99, where it does
not conflict with any other numbers, in the event you have grabbed extra levelsets. This requires SpeedFix or OpenSupaplex. Use the levelset swap function to navigate to the number you chose. If you used LEVELS.D30, for example, you need to navigate to Levelset 30.
* * You can safely move LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT into an easy-access folder if you use Megaplex. Use the "Open" function and navigate to said folder.

The DOSBox SpeedFix version or OpenSupaplex is preferred to play this levelset, as there is the capability of creating savestates.
I will not offer support for installations on commercial/"freemium" ports. You are responsible for wasted money.
