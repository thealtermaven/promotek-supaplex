# promotek-supaplex
"The Promotek Incident", a Supaplex levelset.

This repo is created with the intent to help document versioning of edits for the levelset, including adding credits of individuals whom assisted in the edits of the levelset for the purpose of fixing outstanding bugs.

To grab this levelset:
* Use "Clone/Download" and elect to save as zip.
* Extract contents in an empty folder.
* Navigate to the desired version (newer versions have edits/fixes).
* Open !README.TXT and follow install instructions.
* * This usually involves backing up the original LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT if you are using vanilla DOSBox Supaplex.
* * You can also opt to change LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT to LEVEL.L?? and LEVELS.D?? where ?? is a number from 00-99, where it does
not conflict with any other numbers, in the event you have grabbed extra levelsets. This requires SpeedFix or OpenSupaplex. Use the levelset swap function to navigate to the number you chose. If you used LEVELS.D30, for example, you need to navigate to Levelset 30.
* * You can safely move LEVEL.LST and LEVELS.DAT into an easy-access folder if you use Megaplex.

This levelset requires Supaplex. You can get it for free. I prefer you to use the DOSBox SpeedFix version, Megaplex or OpenSupaplex to play this levelset. I do not support commercial or "freemium" ports. Don't ask how to include. Discussion of inclusion will be erased. Those ports are scams to me. They serve no beneficial advantages compared to the above free options. None. Nada.

You can also play the latest version provided to Supaplex.Online (not my site):

* A HTML5 browser is required.
* You can log in anonymously.
* * For better experience (and to play other levelsets, including my 2003 edition Levelset 10!) request a free account with the site's author.

Happy solving!
