1.1 -> 1.11

026 "PYROTECHNOPHOBIA" there was an edge-case involving
errorneous positioning of orange disks that prevented the
rightmost 1/4 of the level to be incompletable without the
usage of expert tricks. This is unintended difficulty for
the nature of this set, and thus was fixed.

(An expert trick involves advanced knowledge of the Supaplex
engine, and thus outside the realm of someone who knows basic
tricks, like zonk bumps and snik redirections. Disintegration
of hardware is an expert trick.)

1.0 -> 1.1

102 "BROUGHT TO YOU BY" infotron count 125 -> 127
user Greg @ Supaplex.Online found an errorneous count. Minor,
but needs the shift anyway

062 "SOLVE IT QUICKLY!" there was a broken mechanism that
disrupted the fuse which basically stopped the exit from
being threatened by the level's mechanic. This was fixed.
